## Build Setup

install dependencies
``` bash
yarn
```

## Run in development env
serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

``` bash
yarn start
```

# NOTE
This is not a lib, tool nor framework. It is a example template to show how combine server and front together work.
First this is a graphql practice, and later add socket.io for transport data, and later remove graphql.
I feel that graphql is just for upgrade from restful, if use websocket, it has no advantage (personal idea).
